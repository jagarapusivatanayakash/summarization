# Summarization using Transformer Models (Including LLaMA 2)

This repository contains code and resources for performing text summarization using various Transformer-based models, including the powerful **LLaMA 2** model alongside other models like BERT, DistilBERT, Pegasus, T5, and RoBERTa. The project demonstrates the fine-tuning of these models on the **CNN Daily Mail** dataset to generate concise and coherent summaries from news articles.

## Features
- Fine-tuning of various Transformer models, including **LLaMA 2** for text summarization tasks.
- Memory-efficient training using **QLoRa** and **LoRa** quantization techniques.
- Detailed evaluation metrics to measure summarization performance.
- Instructions to replicate experiments with custom datasets.

## Models Implemented
- **LLaMA 2 7b** (Large Language Model Meta AI)
- **BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- **DistilBERT** (A smaller, faster, cheaper version of BERT)
- **Pegasus** (Pre-training with Extracted Gap-sentences for Abstractive Summarization)
- **T5** (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer)
- **RoBERTa** (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach)

## Dataset
The models are fine-tuned using the **CNN Daily Mail** dataset, which is widely used for text summarization tasks and consists of news articles paired with human-written summaries.

### Dataset Structure
- **Articles**: Long-form news articles.
- **Summaries**: Short summaries corresponding to each article.

## Quantization Techniques
To optimize the training process, the following quantization techniques are employed:
- **QLoRa**: Quantization-aware LoRa, which reduces memory usage while maintaining performance.
- **LoRa**: A low-rank adaptation technique that reduces trainable parameters, speeding up training and inference.
